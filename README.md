Describe Dynamics in Prospective Life Cycle Assessment

Independent modification of background and foreground data for streamlined scenario modelling of time-differentiated life cycle inventories.

Background data for each time step can be imported using [premise](https://github.com/polca/premise). Foreground data can be created for each time step absolutely or using relative information, which must be defined simultaneously. Inventory calculations are carried out using methods from [brightway2](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2). Also arbitrary static impact categories can be applied. Foreground scenarios can be modified successively in short time while background data remains unchanged.

The time-differentiated inventory results can be used for dynamic impact assessment by calculating the additional radiative forcing from greenhouse gas emissions.
